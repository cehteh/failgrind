* Introduction

  Failgrind is a uses gdb to instrument a program for checking coverage over error paths.

* How it works

  The user registers functions where errors shall be injected together with gdb instructions
  that define how to inject this error:

  : Intercept('malloc', ['set *__errno_location()=12', 'return (void*)0'])
  : Intercept('open', [['set *__errno_location()=13', 'return (int)-1'], #EACCESS
  :                    ['set *__errno_location()=2', 'return (int)-1'], #ENOENT
  :                   ])

  Failgrind intercepts these functions and calculates a checksum over the backtrace leading to
  the call. This checksum identifies every possibly path leading to the call uniquely. It
  keeps a database if this path was already checked and iterates through the defined
  injections and records the state.

  The program is started repeatly and crashes are recorded, eventually permutating over all
  possible error paths.
